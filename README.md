#Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
- I really didn't have a set plan going into this. I really would like in the future now having some experience with the subject matter. I want to go in an follow the test that are written and really trying to understand what the tests are trying to do. 

What was hard about working with code you did not write?
- The hardest part about working with code you didn't write is trying to follow the logic. I feel like this time it was pretty reigned in as far as how easy the logic of the code was to follow. I'm confident that there are going to be occasions where it is very challenging to figure out what is going on without being able to pick the brain of the person who wrote it. Asking what they were thinking and trying to do in specific instances

What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
- There wasn't really a ton that was easy for me. The debugging felt good because that is what where I have had the most practice thus far. What made me feel the most confortable was limiting how daunting the project was. I really needed to drop things into manageable chunks that were more easy to work through.
